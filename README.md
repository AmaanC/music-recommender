##About:

This project uses LastFM's dataset to find similar bands, and to make recommendations to users based on those computed [cosine similarities.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) What I've implemented is a primitive form of [collaborative filtering.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering)

It was made for a college miniproject for the introductory Database Management Systems course, and therefore is only a proof-of-concept, not a fully-fledged "app".

##Technology Stack:

PostgreSQL - Database server

Python - Backend web server

Bootstrap (HTML, CSS, JS) - Frontend website
